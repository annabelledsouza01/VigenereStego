To run the code:

1. Copy-paste the 4 codes in the same folder on the computer. (If you are using netbeans or any other IDE, copy-paste them in the same java package.)

2. Run the file "Steganography_Controller.java" because that has the main class to run the full code.

3. A Java Swings UI will appear. On the top-left, choose either encode or decode according to which function you wish to do. If you are running this code for the first time then please choose "encode".


for ENCODING:

4. Type your desired text in the text area and then click the button at the bottom that says "encode now". It will prompt you to choose an image in which to embed the Cipher Text. PLEASE CHOOSE ONLY A .png OR A .jpg FILE as only those formats are supported in this code. Enter what name you would like to give to the output steganograph image and click ok. 
Please note that blank spaces and punctuation will not be considered for encryption. Even if you type them in your Plain Text they will not show up in your decoded text later.


for DECODING:

5. Choose "Decode" in the top left. Select the steganographic image to be decoded. (Select the output image of the previous step) and click the button on the bottom saying "Decode now". Your text will appear in the text area.
